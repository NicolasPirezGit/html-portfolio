<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie. The whole living-in-a-simulation theme really captured me.</p>

<h3>She</h3>
<p>Really good movie depicting an ever more likely reality when it comes to love and AI.</p>

<h3>Scarface</h3>
<p>Entering the life of drug lord Tony Montana, this movie is about ambition, hubris and downfall.</p>
